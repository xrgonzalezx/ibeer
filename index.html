        <p>Freeing a trapped bear, leading a midnight hike through the jungle, playing a rousing game of jai alai—it’s all in a day’s work for the Most Interesting Man in the World. The 15 second spots are brilliantly written with quotable quips that invite
          parody – “The police often question him just because they find him interesting;” “He once had an awkward moment, just to see how it feels;” “His blood smells like cologne;” “His beard alone has experienced more than a lesser man’s entire body.”</p>

        <p>Sunburned and silver-haired, Goldsmith’s character dangles a bottle of Dos Equis from thumb and forefinger, presumably unwinding after his latest escapade. “I don’t always drink beer,” he rumbles. “But when I do, I prefer Dos Equis.”</p>

        <p>Dos Equis is a lager that was originally brewed by the German-born Mexican brewer Wilhelm Hasse in 1897. The brand was named “Siglo XX” (“20th century”) to commemorate the arrival of the new century, and the bottles were marked with the Roman
          numerals “XX”, or “Dos Equis” (two Xs).</p>

        <p>The main brand Dos Equis XX Special Lager is a 4.45% abv pale lager sold in green bottles. Dos Equis XX Ambar is a 4.7% Vienna-style amber lager sold in brown bottles, and was first exported to the United States in 1973.</p>

        <p>Stepping onto The World feels like boarding a 21st-century Titanic, such is its scale and grandeur. Sitting majestically in Hong Kong's Victoria Harbor, this gleaming 644 feet-long white vessel is the largest, and probably most exclusive, "residential
          yacht" on earth.</p>

      <h3>Jonathan Goldsmith</h3>

      <p>Jonathan Goldsmith (born September 26, 1938) is an American actor. He began his career on the New York stage, then started a career in film and television. He appeared in several TV shows from the 1960s to the 1990s. He is best known for appearing
        in television commercials for Dos Equis beer, from 2006 to 2016, as the character The Most Interesting Man in the World.</p>

      <p>Jonathan has made over 350 television appearances in his career. Among them was the role of Marvin Palmer in the 1964 Perry Mason episode, "The Case of the Blonde Bonanza." To advance his acting career, Goldsmith moved to California from New
        York in 1966. Like many aspiring actors, he found it difficult to gain enough acting work to survive and wound up working various jobs, including driving a garbage truck and working in construction, to help make ends meet.</p>
